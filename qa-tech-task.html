        <h3>QA Coding Task</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Welcome to OLIO's technical task for QAs. For this we'd like to you test a few public endpoints of the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and the Github UI</p>

<p>We have three things that we'd like you to test:</p>
<ol>
  <li>View the OLIOEX organisation's public github repositories, specifically we'd like you to test that:
    <ul>
      <li>`proximityhash` repository exists</li> 
      <li>what licence it uses</li>
      <li>how many stars the repository has</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li>Test that you are able to view the latest list of commits for that repository</li>
  <li>Fetch the latest commiter and check that their name and avatar match expectations</li>
</li>

<p>As this position is has a manual and an automated aspect we'd like you to deliver these as both a set of manual test scenarios and an automated test suite. We're leaving this deliberately vague to see what and how is appropriate to test.</p>

<p>Once you are done please email lloyd@olioex.com with the code, or a link to the code. After this we'll arrange a follow up technical interview to discuss what you submitted. Also if you haven't previously used the app it would be a good idea to have given it a go before your interview (bonus points for organising a collection 😀).</p>

<p>If you have any questions please feel free to email myself at any time.</p>

<p>Cheers, Lloyd.</p>
