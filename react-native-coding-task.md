Hello,

Welcome to OLIO's technical task. For this task we'd like you to create a basic react native based android app (that we could install and try). This isn't designed to take a long time and we're more interested to see how you go about the process of coding up the app rather than the final result. 

Your audience is someone who has never run/used react native previously, but would like to get the app built and deployed on google play at some point.

Firstly, the list of articles is stored here, https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/olio-staging-images/developer/articles.json, and you'll need to pull this from the server on load (as it may change).

It would be great if you could display the list of articles on the page, and possibly show a map with some interaction to link it to the article itself.

Lastly, we'd like to be able to flag an article as 'seen', so when the user interacts with the article in some way it gets marked as such'. I'll leave you to decide what the interaction should be.

Once you are done please email lloyd@olioex.com with the code, or a link to the code. After this we'll arrange a follow up technical interview to discuss what you submitted. Also if you haven't previously used the app it would be a good idea to have given it a go before your interview (bonus points for organising a collection 😀).

If you have any questions please feel free to email myself at any time.

Cheers, Lloyd.
