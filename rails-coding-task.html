        <h3>Ruby-On-Rails Coding Task</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Welcome to OLIO's technical task. For this we'd like you to create a basic rails app (that we could run and try). This isn't designed to take a long time and we're more interested to see how you go about the process of coding up the app rather than the final result.</p?

<p>Your audience is someone who has never run/used rails previously, but would like to get the app server running and experiment on the local environment.</p>

<p>Firstly, the list of articles is stored here, <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/olio-staging-images/developer/test-articles-v3.json">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/olio-staging-images/developer/test-articles-v3.json</a>, and you'll need to pull this from the server on page load (as it may change).</p>

<p>It would be great if you could display the list of articles on the page. Lastly, we'd like to be able to'like' an article, with the data persisted and updated with each new page load. The likes are global and not per user.</p>

<p>Once you are done please email lloyd@olioex.com with the code, or a link to the code. After this we'll arrange a follow up technical interview to discuss what you submitted. Also if you haven't previously used the app it would be a good idea to have given it a go before your interview (bonus points for organising a collection 😀).</p>

<p>If you have any questions please feel free to email myself at any time.</p>

<p>Cheers, Lloyd.</p>
